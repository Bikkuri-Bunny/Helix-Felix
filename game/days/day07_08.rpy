  a "-sigh-"
  "Something really is bothering him."
  "I can tell because we're so close. He's been caring for me for ten years now. We're best friends. He should be able to tell me anything that might be on his mind."
  "So why does it feel like he's hiding something?"
  "I don't want him to feel blue. I want to make him feel better. I want to be there for him, like he's always been there for me."
  "I guess I have to step up and let him know he can talk to me somehow."
  "Hopefully this was a good first step."

  a "Oh, okay. Well I'm going to stay here and clean up my mess. Have a good night."
  s happy "Have a good night, Addison. I'll see you in the morning."

  "I'm true to my word and I let the picture dry out while I sort out the supplies. I wipe them down and place them back in their boxes, sorted by colors, until everything is neat again."
  "Well, almost neat. Some of the boxes don't quite close right anymore. But it's okay, just as long as it's close enough."
  "By the time I finished cleaning, the painting was mostly dry. At this time of night, Pumpkin should be..."
  "Uh..."
  "I have no idea where Pumpkin would be."

  "But even so, there's doubts in the back of my mind... our situtations are so different... We're practically oposites."
  "I stayed here because I'm concidered 'broken', but he's staying because he's so pretty and confident..."
  "No one wants me, but everyone want's him..."
  "But that shouldn't change our relationship, right?"
  "We can still become even closer as family."
