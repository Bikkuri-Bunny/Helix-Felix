  "Feeling his warmth, how I can make him tremble before even getting him hard all the way... It makes me feel sort of powerful."
  "My cheeks cave in as I suck on him, waiting to feel him harden in my mouth."

  l "Mmmhh..."

  "He likes it. His hand in my hair is slow and lazy. I don't know what it is about his fingers on my scalp, but it makes me shiver happily."
  "I can feel his pulse on my tongue. He's getting bigger, filling up my mouth,"

  "Pressing against the back of my tongue. The fullness is letting me know he wants me."

  l "Addy..."

  "Or he can be more direct, like calling my name, gripping my hair, and pulling me closer. I did my best not to choke."

  a "Mmmh."

  "The satisfaction of it all makes it hard for me to stall the best move I have."
  "Dr. Kronauer really needs me and he really wants me around. He loves me and holds me close and that's more than enough to tip me over the edge here."

  a "-purrrr-"
  l "Ah- ahh!"

  "The vibrations come from the back of my throat. I can feel them through my whole body, and I'm sure Dr. Kronauer can feel them through his tip, then his entire dick. I rub his balls slowly, feeling it there as well. I don't need a vibrator when I can do this for Dr. Kronauer all by myself."

  l "Addy..."

  "I feel him buck up into me, hand firm on the back of my head. There's nowhere for me to go and there's no room for his dick to go further so I ended up gagging."

  a "Mhh!"
  l "S-Sorry."

  "I tell him I accept his apology by continuing to purr."

  a "-purr purrr-"
  l "Ohhh..."

  "I can't smile with his cock in my mouth. He should be done soon, I can tell. The way his hips tremble and he continues to try and push into me. Even his dick is twitching against the motion of my tongue. I hollow out my cheeks again to help him along. His precum is tart in my mouth."

  l "Addy, I..."
  a "Mmhmm, -puurrrr-"
  l "Ohhh...."

  "Just a little more..."

  l "Ah, ah- ah!"

  "He hasn't opened his eyes. I can only grin as I look up at him."

  l "Mh- Addy. You did that on purpose."

  "I grin. I did. But his dick is still twitching, so it already did its job. I lean in and suck his head one last time to taste the last of his milk."

  l "Ah-"

  "Pulling back I start wiping the rest off my face."

  l "Do you like it on your face? Why would you do that?"

  "I lick my fingers and he turns redder."

  l "You're just trying to get me hard again."
  a "Maybe."
  l "Addy. -sigh- Lunch time's over. You know the rules."
  a "Aww."

  "I'm kidding, I'm not that upset over it, but my teasing isn't done yet. He fumbles with his pants, putting himself away and zipping back up."

  l "I'm sorry, but I have to get back to work."
  a "Maybe next time then."

  "I stand, but he grabs my arm to pull me back down to his level, stealing a kiss."

  l "Next time."

  s laugh "Oh, I'm sorry Addison. Thank you for helping."

  "Before I know it, I've happily wasted a few hours. The staff are packing up to go home."
