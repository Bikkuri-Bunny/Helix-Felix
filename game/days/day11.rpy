  "I try to blink awake, sitting up in bed and looking over Pumpkin, who's still sitting on my legs. Mr. Jesse is even here, standing in the doorway, and I rub my eyes."

  a pajamas "What?"
  p "You're coming with me!"
  a pajamas "I'm doing what?"

  "Pumpkin sits back and pouts."

  p sad "Addy, wake up."
  p excited "It was a surprise! It'll be super fun- you're going to do a shoot with me!"

      p "Yeah!"

  "Pumpkin hops off of me, pulling me out of bed. It's cold and uncomfortable to be rushed like this."

  p "Come on, you don't even gotta get dressed. We'll get changed after they do our hair and makeup."

  "It still doesn't make sense and I blink wearily at Mr. Jesse, hoping maybe he has the answer. He only shrugs."

  j "Just get ready. Pumpkin, make sure you two aren't late. I'll be down setting everything up."

  "At least I can brush my teeth in peace then."

  a pajamas "When did they decide this?"
  p "I got to pick what we would do today last week."

  "He sits on the bed, kicking his legs as I stumble around and finalize on at least brushing my hair and washing my face. Not getting dressed into day clothes feels wrong, but I know Pumpkin's excited enough he might not let me at all."

  p "So, I decided I wanted to do something with you!! And they let me pick the theme and it's Halloween!!"

  "Of course it is."

  p "Are you excited? It's going to be a lot of fun!"
  a smile "Ah, yeah. I hope so."

  "As soon as I've set down my hairbrush Pumpkin has me by the hand, pulling me towards the photography room. I should be used to this by now. Mr. Jesse is waiting at the end of the hallway to key us through the door. He doesn't say a word, handing us off to the same lady as before."

  o "Good morning you two, here you are-"
  p "Okay, Addy, come on."

  "Pumpkin seems content as we're pushed to uncomfortable seats, but as strangers come at us with brushes and strange electric tools my shoulders rise and my hair strands on end, puffing up my tail."

  a nervous "Pumpkin?"
  p smile "It's okay Addy, they're just going to make us pretty."
  a "I don't know..."
  o "It's alright."

  "Pumpkin lifts his chin and closes his eyes with a smile, letting the lady go right to painting his face. My arms cross over my stomach."

  p "You'll get used to it."
  a "..."

  "Trying to prepare myself for the same fate, the woman in front of me grimaces as she touches my hair."

  o "Oauh... When was the last time you had this cut?"
  a blush "Ah, I don't know... I always end up missing haircut days..."
  o "We don't have time for that... Well, it'll have to do, I guess I can..."

  "She mumbles to herself as I close my eyes and try not to fidget away from her touches. Even if Pumpkin thinks I'll get used to this, I don't think I want to. The paint on my face is wet and sticky and my fingers curl just trying to keep myself from touching it. I can feel whatever hot tools the woman is using on my hair as they brush too close to my ears or my cheeks, but I don't dare look."

  a "Mm..."

  "The smells of the paints, powders, and sprays are almost as bad as the textures. My nose wrinkles. Pumpkin didn't even ask if I wanted to do this... But I have to be supportive."

  o "Okay, all right. That'll do."

  "I practically leap from the chair when she lets me go, still nervously gripping the bottom of my pajama shirt to keep from touching my face."

  o "And your costumes-"
  a confused "What are-"
  p excited "They're perfect!!!"

  "Pumpkin snatches up the costume with starry eyes. Now I really can't complain."
  a costume sad "-sigh-"

  "Actually... they seem to fit really nicely at least."

  a costume sad smile "It'll be fine."

  "I follow after him onto the stage. The bright lights have me squinting, but I can tell it's decorated just as lavishly as before. It's a fake living room, with a fireplace, pumpkins, decorations, couch and chairs. The kind of place I might have imagined spending a rainy day in with a Master..."
  "The most beautiful thing on the set though is Pumpkin's grin. I should just let myself enjoy this like he does."
  "His hand slips into mine."

  p "Now we just have to look cute."

  "Jesse nods idly. Pumpkin puts his hands on my waist."

  a costume confused "Like... this?"

  "I smile at the camera as Pumpkin laughs."

  p "You'll learn soon."

  "His tips and the camera man's suggestions make it easier, but I can still feel how stiff my actions and poses are. Pumpkin keeps trying to turn my face away from the camera, to make silly jokes and teases at me. I can tell he's trying to calm me down."
  "I'm not embarrassed I don't think... It's just all so different and strange."
  "He really is helping though. After a while I can giggle and laugh as we snuggle with each other on the plush rug by the fireplace."

  a costume smile "Hey, that tickles!"
  a costume laugh "No! No, stop- haha!"
  p "Tell me I'm cute!"
  a costume "You're cute! You're cute! Cuter than me- I surrender- aha!"
  p "Hehehe, okay."
  a costume smile "Ah, not fair."
  p "You're more ticklish than I thought you would be."
  a costume "Are you ticklish?"
  p "Don't."
  a costume "I won't! I won't!"

  "We keep up the act, playing with some stuffed toys as props, laughing and posing, until the photographer lowers his camera."

  o "Alright, break for lunch."
  a costume surprised "Already?"
  p "Yeah. I told you it would be fun."
  "His face lights up as he stuffs his mouth full of food."
  p "An' the 'ood is 'good too!"
  a costume laugh "Haha, don't talk with your mouth full, Pumpkin."
  p "Haha."
  a costume "You don't do it at breakfast. So don't do it at lunch."
  "I'm so used to drilling etiquite into the kittens."
  p "Fine, fine."

  p "Yeah, at breakfast I'm too tired to talk."
  p "I'm not a morning person."
  a "That's okay."
  show pumpkin happy costume
  p "I'm excited to have you here- like really excited!"
  p "Since I don't talk at breakfast, I'm starting to get kinda lonely at the shoots."
  p "Even with all the humans, I miss the kittens."
  a costume "They miss you too."
  p "Aw, that's cute."
  "He stuffs his face again. I nibble on a small sandwich."
  p "Okay, eat more, we gotta get back to work soon."
  a costume "Oh, okay."

  "He eats his fill as I try to eat a little faster. I'm a really slow eater though..."
  "The camera man calls us back over soon, just like Pumpkin said."
  "We do more of the same shots, cuddling in front of the fireplace."

  o "You- your name is Addison, right?"
  a costume "Ah, yes."
  o "Pumpkin, undo your shorts for me. Addison, stand behind him and stroke him off."
  a costume confused "H-huh??" #no animations for surprised addison

His eyes widened, and I could feel his heartbeat skip, blood heating up.
Pumpkin.surprised: Huh? Uh- Um...
His eyes glanced up to me, eyelashes long and low his strained to meet my gaze. I was just as confused.
Pumpkin.blush: Um, okay.
Addison: But-
Director: Come on, just have fun, you two.
I blushed as well. This was all so sudden, and I could tell that Pumpkin felt stiff in my arms as soon as the suggestion was made.
Pumpkin: It's okay, let's just do it.
Addison: But-
He snuggled back into me, pressing his head beneath my chin and his back into my stomach.
Pumpkin: Come on, d-don't argue.
My fingers twitches as I realized what he meant.
Addison.blush: Ah... okay...
I was used to giving out hand-jobs... this shouldn't be much different. But the hot lights and the cameras clicking made me nervous, made me keep my eyes down and try to hide my face in Pumpkin's hair.
My hand fumbled with his pants. When they were open and I freed Pumpkin's cock from his underwear, I tried not worry about how flaccid he still was. It was all for show, anyways. I just... had to make him feel good, like any other Staff Companion duty I had.
Addison: Okay...
I stroked him slowly, running my thumb over his flesh. He would be hard soon, regardless. I just had to touch him right.
Pumpkin: Ah...
I nuzzled my nose into his ear.
Addison: You're so pretty.
His breath hitched. His eye opened slightly to look back at me.
Addison: Really. You're so beautiful. I'm so glad you're my friend.
Pumpkin: Mh...
I needed to make him comfortable in order for this to work... The cameras were still clicking away, and I could feel the sweat on the back of my neck from the hot lights.
My free hand was already around Pumpkin, and I moved it gently to pet his chest as I stroked. He closed his eyes again.
Pumpkin: Ah...
I could feel his shoulders relaxing. That was good.
Addison.smile: I've never done with with another Felix before... It's nice... You're pretty and it's lucky we get to spend time together. I like spending it with you.
Pumpkin: Mh...
He was hard now, his dick firm in my hand as I pumped. 
Addison: Just a little more.
Pumpkin: Addy...
I nuzzled into him again. He was pressing further against me. I kissed his ear. I had seen the one time he had sex, but I wasn't sure if it was always like that for him. Were his fake Masters ever nice to him when they had sex? Did he get to cuddle and kiss them, relax and feel their warmth shared?
Our jobs were so different...
I hoped I could get him to feel happy with this.
Addison: I know.
I could feel him welling up, close to climax.
With only a little whimper he came, eyes still pressed closed, arms shaking as his fingers pressed into mine. 
Addison: There...

  a "Alright..."

  "His dick is still limp. As I softly wrap my fingers around it I can feel him relaxing into me, his chin tilting up as I fondle him."
  "I keep my eyes low, not wanting to look at the camera. Instead I hide my face halfway in Pumpkin's neck."

  p "Ahh..."

  "One of his hands reaches back to rest on my waist. I can feel his breath on my cheek as his breathing grows hotter."
  "His eyes flicker over to the camera man, and he whispers."

  p "Addy, we should kiss."
  a confused "Huh?"
  p "Please?"

  "But he doesn't wait. It's alright. I would have said ‘yes’ anyways. His kisses feel small, his mouth barely open. I can hear the camera shutter clicking rapidly."
  "With my free hand, I lift part of Pumpkin's shirt, fingers at the ready."

  a "..."
  a "Tickles!"
  p laugh "Ah! No! No not while I'm-! Addy!"

  "We both are laughing, doubling over even as I stop and we're chided by the staff."
  "I giggle as I kiss his cheek."

  a "Sorry."
  p "It's fine. Just don't do it again."
  a "Yeah, yeah."

  "We get back into position and I nuzzle my nose into his hair again, still nervous to look at the camera, but at least the laughter made me a little less hesitant to touch Pumpkin."
  "Pumpkin isn't hard yet, probably because I made him laugh. My bad."
  "I try to be extra soft with him now, taking his ear between my lips."

  p "Ah!"

  "I can't smile or my teeth might bite him."
  "Instead I give small sucks and kisses to the silky skin of Pumpkin's ear. I could feel it bending back as he pressed his back into me."

  p "Ah..."

  "I just run fingers along him softly for a while before taking him firmly in my hand. I stroke him slowly at first. It takes awhile, but I think that the camera man enjoys it."
  "I alternate between slow and fast untill.."

  "Pumpkin was nice and hard now."
  "It didn't take long, and with a few more kisses he broke away from me, squirming too hard for me to keep my lips on him. He moaned as his dick twitched, coming into my hand."

  a "There..."
  p "Ahh... Addy..."

  "I nuzzle his cheek with my nose, smiling."

  o "Pumpkin, lick it off his hand."
  a costume confused "Huh?"

  "Before I could say anything Pumpkin had my fingers in his mouth, his tongue running up the side."
  "Our jobs really were wildly different, weren't they?"
  "I hid my face in Pumpkin's hair."
  "Pleasuring someone with touch and love..."
  "Doing it for a camera didn't feel the same at all. I wiggle and hide my face in his neck while he sucked at my fingers."
  "It felt like forever under the hot lights but soon the camera man called out again."
